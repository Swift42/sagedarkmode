# **Sage Dark Mode**

### **Features**
This extension intercepts network requests to the starmap background images and replaces them with dark images

### Limits
It is not possible to get rid of the glowing border (because the glowing border isn't an image), but I did my best to make it look as soft as possible.

### Installation

- Unzip the downloaded file
